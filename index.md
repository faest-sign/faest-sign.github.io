title: "Come and join the FAEST"
---

FAEST is a digital signature algorithm designed to be secure against quantum computers.
The security of FAEST is based on standard cryptographic hashes and ciphers, specifically [SHA3][sha3_spec] and [AES][aes_spec], which are believed to remain secure against quantum adversaries.

## Design

In FAEST, the secret signing key is an AES key, while the public verification key is a plaintext-ciphertext pair, obtained by encrypting a random message under the signing key. A signature consists of a non-interactive zero-knowledge proof of knowledge of an AES key which maps the message to the ciphertext. This follows the design principle of the [Picnic signature scheme][picnic], except using the well-analyzed AES cipher as a one-way function instead of LowMC.

FAEST's efficiency results from a new zero-knowledge proof technique called VOLE-in-the-head, which improves upon the established MPC-in-the-head paradigm.
VOLE-in-the-head allows for a faster implementation with smaller proofs than previous approaches, while still requiring only symmetric-key primitives like SHA3 and AES.
FAEST does not need stronger cryptographic hardness assumptions like LWE, CSIDH, syndrome decoding, etc.

## Variants

There are several parameters controlling the instantiation of FAEST, giving differing tradoffs between security, speed, and compactness.
First there's the security parameter, which determines both the complexity of the statement to prove, and the security level of the zero knowledge proof itself.
For 128-bit security we only need to prove AES-128 once, while for 256-bit security we need to prove AES-256 twice, as AES has a 128-bit block size.

Second, we hanve a Even-Mansour variant where the block cipher is used as an ideal permutation by publishing its key, run on a secret input.
This avoids proving the key schedule, since it is public, but when the security parameter is 192 or 256 it requires using Rijndael with larger block sizes, as only the 128-bit block size was standardized as AES.

Third, our zero-knoweldge proof admits a communication‚Äìcomputation tradeoff, since it is built using [SoftSpokenVOLE][ssot].
This is controlled by a parameter *ùúè*, with communication being roughly proportional to *ùúè*.
FAEST has two settings for *ùúè* for each security level: a "**s**low and short" setting, and a "**f**ast but long" setting.

## Performance

For 128-bit security, our optimized implementation of FAEST can sign or verify in 0.9 milliseconds (for signatures of size 6.5 kilobytes) or 8.1 milliseconds (for signatures of size 5 kilobytes). When using AES in Even‚ÄìMansour mode, signature size can be further reduced to 4.6 kilobytes. Here are the benchmarks for our [AVX2](/software.html) implementation.
